# Inria AlphaZ
This documentation is for the newer version of AlphaZ developed initially at Inria,
then forked and continued to be developed at CSU.
This also includes its version of the Alpha language.

At some point, we should migrate this information to the AlphaZ repo.
However, let's do that once this documentation is more fleshed out.

The table below lists the documents in this directory and a quick description of each.
