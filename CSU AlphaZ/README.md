# CSU AlphaZ
This documentation is for the older version of AlphaZ developed at CSU,
along with its version of the Alpha language.

At some point, we should migrate this information to the AlphaZ Wiki,
or to the AlphaZ repository itself.
However, let's do that once this documentation is more fleshed out.

The table below lists the documents in this directory and a quick description of each.

| Document                                                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
